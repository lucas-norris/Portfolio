      <hr>
      <p>
        Hello! My web journey began back in 2019 when I started managing a number of e-commerce sites. I mainly worked on SEO and digital marketing, this led to an opportunity to create a couple of e-commerce sites from scratch.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        I learned a lot about Magento and Shopify and was introduced to code for the first time. I dabbled in a bit of HTML and CSS and was surprised by the power of code. This piqued my interest, and when the Dev Academy opportunity came along I knew had to jump at the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm so glad I took the leap, and know that changing careers was definitely the right choice for me. I'm curious and excited for the future, and getting more passionate about software development every day.
